This is an ongoing project that aims to create a cheap, easy-to-use controller for those that have the usage of one hand. It uses a custom PCB and a Wii Nunchuck that can act as either a wired Nintendo Switch controller or a keyboard and mouse, depending on the sketch that's uploaded. 
This is not something I intend to sell for more than $20, and that will likely include shipping and handling. 

I don't know if this can replace some of the more-expensive controllers that are out there, but it is an inexpensive option and it will still open up a ton of games to those that may not have been able to experience them before.

For the Nintendo Switch version, here are the mappings:

 - Holding C: 
   - Up = X 
   - Down = B 
   - Right = A 
   - Left = Y

 - Holding Z: 
   - Up = ZL toggle 
   - Down = ZR toggle 
   - Left = LB 
   - Right = RB

- Holding C & Z: 
   - Up = Plus 
   - Down = Minus 
   - Left = L3 toggle 
   - Right = R3 toggle

- Gestures:
   - Flicking Up = B
   - Flicking Right = A
   - hold just C & Z for 1.5 seconds = toggle between LAnalog and DPad for the joystick on the nunchuck
   - Accelerometer = Right Analog Stick control

I'll upload the mappings for the keyboard and mouse as I finalize that one, but right now the accelerometer is mapped to the mouse and keys are mapped to the joystick and its modifiers, just like the Switch version.
