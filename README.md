This is an ongoing project that aims to create a cheap, easy-to-use controller for those that have the usage of one hand. It uses a custom PCB and a Wii Nunchuck that can act as either a wired Nintendo Switch controller or a keyboard and mouse, depending on the sketch that's uploaded. 
This is not something I intend to sell for more than $20, and that will likely include shipping and handling. 

I don't know if this can replace some of the more-expensive controllers that are out there, but it is an inexpensive option and it will still open up a ton of games to those that may not have been able to experience them before.

In order to cover as many games as possible, I have provided a couple of control schemes. Whether using the Switch version or the PC version, while connecting the USB, hold the C button to enter the alternate mode.

For the Nintendo Switch version, here are the mappings:

 - Holding C: 
   - Up = X 
   - Down = B 
   - Right = A 
   - Left = Y

 - Holding Z: 
   - Up = ZL toggle 
   - Down = ZR 
   - Left = LB 
   - Right = RB

- Holding C & Z: 
   - Up = Plus 
   - Down = Minus 
   - Left = L3
   - Right = R3

 - Hold just C & Z for 4 seconds:
   - toggle between the analog stick and DPad for the joystick on the nunchuck

 - If C wasn't held during USB connection:
    - Joystick = Right Analog Stick
    - Accelerometer = Left Analog Stick
  
 - If C was held during USB connection:
    - Joystick = Left Analog Stick
    - Acclerometer = Right Analog Stick  

I find that using the accelerometer as movement is awesome for first-person games, such as Borderlands and even Skyrim. Using the joystick for movement is great for classic games on the Switch, such as A Link to the Past or Mario. At the end of the day, it will come down to preference, but I wanted people to have options.

Being able to toggle the left trigger has been great for games like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom so that you can still shield parry, or in shooting games, you can toggle aiming down sights (ADS), even if the game doesn't offer it as an option. 




- KBM Mode
   - I'll upload the mappings for the keyboard and mouse as I finalize that one, but right now the accelerometer is mapped to the mouse and keys are mapped to the joystick and its modifiers, just like the Switch version.
