This is an ongoing project that aims to create a cheap, easy-to-use controller for those that have the usage of only one hand. 

In order to cover as many games as possible, I have provided a couple of control schemes, depending on the direction of the toggle on the circuit board.

The controller uses a custom circuit board that is paired with an Arduino Pro Micro and an MPU6050 Accelerometer. It has full compatibility as a wired controller for the Nintendo Switch, PC (including STEAM), Steam Deck, and Android phones (with an OTG cable or adapter).

There are four main buttons that act as the A, B, X, and Y. When you press the joystick in, those buttons switch to LB, RB, RT, and LT. Press left shift (color-coded differently) and those buttons turn into Start, Select, L3, and R3. Press right shift and they become the DPAD. 

A switch at the bottom of the controller lets you toggle between moving with the accelerometer/aiming with the stick and moving with the stick and aiming with the accelerometer.

I recommend using a USB cable with a right-angle connector so you can rest your arm comfortably.
